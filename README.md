# Project Overview

## Project Name

Mydiem newsreader clone

## Project Description

Mydiem is a limited-functionality clone of the user-sourced news blog Medium - https://medium.com/.
A large-ish database of schematized lorem ipsum data will represent articles, stats, and content.
This project will be a self-guided study in design fidelity and architecture.  The challenge is to apply React and CSS extended frameworks to create highly scalable code that directs high-volume rendering while preserving cohesive organization and style.  This will also be a localized experiment of CRUD functionality with observable analogies to a real-world cases.  
I am hoping this practice will prepare me well for working with a UX student in P3.

### MVP/PostMVP

The functionality will then be divided into two separate lists: MPV and PostMVP.  Carefully decided what is placed into your MVP as the client will expect this functionality to be implemented upon project completion.  

#### MVP 

- Render "Main Feed page" with 
  - functional bookmark -- bookmarked items will appear in the Reading List portion of the Feed
  
- Render dynamically generated URL addressed Article pages that relate exactly to their thumbnail links
  - Article pages will have a fold-out Comments section with post and update functionality ** challenge
  
- Replicate the layout styles of medium.com at desktop, tablet, and mobile breakpoints

#### PostMVP  

- Article pages will have incrementing Clap counters and bookmark functions
- dropdown article specific context meny w/ functional "Dismiss this story" button
- Infinite scroll of newsfeed 
- Pop-down menu, notifications peek, separate Reading List page

## SWOT

Strengths: I already have some practice/experience generating HTML content through iterators, and organizing "high volume" elements from a high level
           I have a very keen eye and focus when driven to reproduce things in detail
           
Weaknesses: I tend to run behind my own schedule, consistently, and expend energy fretting about it.

Opportunities: Excellent chance to demonstrate my capability for abstraction and scalability.  Excellent opportunity to go "scavenger hunting" through Bulma's 
                UI components to build quickly with professional style. 

Threats: No telling what kind of distractions/difficulties may lay in implementing Bulma - will be very documentation dependant.
         The challenges of the comment section are substantial.
